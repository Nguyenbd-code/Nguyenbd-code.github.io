# Study Buddy – ICS 314 Group Project (Fall 2025)

## Overview
Study Buddy is a collaborative web application built to help University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa ICS students find and organize in-person study sessions in ICSpace. Students can register as "sensei" (knowledgeable in certain courses) or "grasshopper" (seeking help), create study sessions, browse available sessions via a calendar, and join them. The app ensures UH-only access and promotes productive peer learning.

## My Contributions
In a team of 3 using Issue-Driven Project Management on GitHub:
- Designed and implemented user profile management features, including course selection, sensei/grasshopper roles, and profile photo uploads.
- Integrated Google OAuth 2.0 authentication restricted to @hawaii.edu accounts.
- Built session creation forms with validation and real-time calendar integration.
- Wrote end-to-end tests using Playwright and enforced code quality with ESLint and Prettier.
- Participated in milestone planning, code reviews, and deployment to Vercel.

## What I Learned
This was my most substantial software engineering experience to date:
- Full-stack development with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Prisma ORM** connected to PostgreSQL.
- Modern authentication flows and security best practices.
- Agile methodologies, collaborative Git workflows, and professional deployment pipelines.
- The value of automated testing and clean, maintainable code in team settings.
- User-centered design through iterative feedback and real-user deployment.

## Technologies Used
Next.js, React, TypeScript, Bootstrap, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Google OAuth, Playwright, Vercel
