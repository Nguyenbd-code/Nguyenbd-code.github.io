### Project Context

This reflection draws from my contributions to *Study Buddy*, a team-developed application completed as part of ICS 314 in Fall 2025. Throughout the project, spanning three milestones, I participated in planning, implementation, debugging, and feature development, often collaborating via our GitHub project boards for Milestones 1, 2, and 3.

### Effort Estimates

My approach to effort estimation combined personal experience with observations from ongoing work. I drew primarily on familiarity with similar tasks from earlier course exercises, browser-based workouts, and personal projects involving frameworks like Next.js and Supabase. For initial milestone issues—such as authentication setup and user interface forms—I based estimates on how comparable components had progressed in prior assignments.

As the project advanced, I incorporated insights from completed tasks within the same milestones. When certain integration challenges extended beyond initial expectations, I adjusted subsequent estimates to account for similar potential complexities. While not relying on formal historical datasets, this evolving reference to recent experience helped inform progressively more grounded assessments.

### The Value of Estimating in Advance

Even when estimates proved inaccurate, the practice of advance estimation offered substantial benefits. It encouraged early consideration of task complexity, which aided in sequencing work across milestone boards and prevented minor issues from accumulating into bottlenecks.

For instance, lower initial estimates for configuration-related tasks highlighted the need to allocate dedicated sessions early, reducing disruptions to dependent features. Higher estimates for more involved components, such as real-time functionality, prompted proactive discussions on scope and simplification. Overall, the process fostered better workload management and prioritization, providing a framework for balancing project demands with other commitments, regardless of precise alignment with actual outcomes.

### Usefulness of Tracking Actual Effort

Tracking actual effort served as a valuable reflective mechanism. It illuminated recurring patterns, particularly the tendency for research, debugging, and integration phases to require more time than anticipated in early milestones.

These observations informed adjustments in later stages, such as building in additional flexibility for exploratory work. While not dramatically altering mid-project decisions due to timeline constraints, the tracking process enhanced awareness of effort distribution and supported more realistic planning toward the final milestone.

### How I Tracked Actual Effort and Its Accuracy

I tracked effort through best-guess assessments informed by post-session reflection. Updates were recorded directly in issue descriptions, comments, or custom fields on the milestone project boards as tasks progressed or reached completion.

This method allowed association of effort with specific issues where I was involved as assignee or contributor. While straightforward, the approach yielded moderately reliable insights—sufficient for identifying broad trends but inherently limited by reliance on recollection rather than precise timing. It provided an honest representation without excessive overhead.

### Reflection and Improvements for Next Time

In future projects, I would introduce greater structure to both estimation and tracking. This could include briefly noting key assumptions during estimation and capturing rough session durations contemporaneously to support more accurate recollections.

Additionally, decomposing complex tasks earlier and updating effort records more frequently would likely enhance the overall quality and utility of the data. These refinements would build on the foundational benefits observed in this experience.

### AI Assistance in Implementation

Throughout development, I employed AI tools—including Grok by xAI and GitHub Copilot—to assist with code generation, debugging, and design exploration. Time associated with prompt refinement, output verification, and integration was incorporated into coding effort records.

These tools accelerated certain aspects of implementation while introducing necessary verification steps, contributing to a more complete understanding of modern development workflows.

### Conclusion

The effort estimation and tracking process for *Study Buddy*, though imperfect, provided essential structure and insight into project management. It promoted deliberate planning, revealed effort patterns, and highlighted opportunities for refinement in future endeavors.
